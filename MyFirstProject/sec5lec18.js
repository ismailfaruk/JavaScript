/*Programming Challenge: Gym Membership Fees Increase
Section 5, Lecture 18

A gym currently charges $29.99 per month.  It has stated that it raises its monthly fee at the start of every year by 2%.

Write a program which uses a for loop to display the expected rates year by year for a number of years from now between 3 and 10 years 
(this means you should generate a random integer between 3 and 10).  For example, if the randomly generated year was 4, then the program 
would log 4 statements to the console which each say the year followed by the expected monthly fee for that year.*/
