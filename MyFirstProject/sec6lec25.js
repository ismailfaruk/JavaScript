/*Programming Challenge: Fizz Buzz
Section 6, Lecture 25

Write a program that logs the numbers from 1 to 50 to the console using a loop. 

However, for numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 log “FizzBuzz” to the console.  For numbers which are multiples of 3 but not 5 
log “Fizz” instead of the number and for the numbers that are multiples of 5 but not 3 log “Buzz” instead of the number. 

All of the remaining numbers which are not multiples of 3 or 5 should be logged to the console.*/
