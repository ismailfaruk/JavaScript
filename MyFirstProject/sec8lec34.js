/*Programming Challenge: Totals
Section 8, Lecture 34

Paste this 10 x 10 2D array into a JavaScript file:

const arr = [
    [0, 6, 1, 6, 5, 1, 0, 8, 2, 7],
    [4, 6, 3, 7, 9, 1, 0, 2, 3, 6],
    [0, 1, 4, 2, 7, 4, 5, 8, 5, 5],
    [7, 3, 4, 1, 7, 4, 8, 3, 9, 1],
    [1, 0, 2, 3, 9, 0, 6, 5, 7, 3],
    [3, 3, 5, 2, 7, 6, 8, 9, 7, 6],
    [5, 6, 6, 7, 3, 3, 4, 9, 1, 9],
    [6, 3, 5, 4, 7, 0, 8, 9, 1, 2],
    [2, 3, 2, 3, 5, 7, 6, 8, 9, 8],
    [9, 8, 6, 7, 5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 0]
];

Then do the following:

    Create a variable called row and assign it a randomly generated number between 1 and 10.

    Create a variable called column and assign it randomly generated number between 1 and 10 .

    Create a loop that gets the total sum of all of the numbers contained within the row held at arr[row].

    Create a loop that gets the total sum of all of the numbers in column number column of arr.

    At the end of your program, you should use console.log() statements to display row, column, the sum from step 3, and the sum from step 4.*/
