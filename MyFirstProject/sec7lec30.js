/*Programming Challenge: Factorial
Section 7, Lecture 30

Create a function which takes one positive integer as its input and returns its factorial.

To make sure that your function works correctly, you should call it with some inputs like 3, 4, and 5 and log those calls to the console. 
For those inputs, you should get 6, 24, and 120, respectively.*/
